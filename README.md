# A Note of Caution re:CryptoBlades

CryptoBlades taught me a lot of about the nature of ponzi schemes. I do not recommend investing time or money into this game or any of the parent company's subsequent games. Because of this, I can't recommend putting any of your time into installing this add-on JS extension. But I had a lot of fun building it. And I'm proud of the work.

A JS class that enhances the CryptoBlades.io UX experience while offering an edge in battle. BladeMasterJS is open source, but access to the API requires a `.01` BNB tip to the development team every 40 days.  You can still download and install this asset and enjoy a 14 day free trial without having to tip any BNB. 


## Features

* Prominently displays the current user's SKILL balance as well as its converted values in USD and BNB
* Prominently displays the current user's BNB balance as well as its converted values in USD and SKILL
* Shows user BNB fee expenditure for the Cryptoblades game in the following ranges: 24 hours, 7 days, 31 days.
* Adds a battle calculator overlay that shows win percentage (must hover mouse over weapon to begin calculations)
* Adds a fight history breakdown that shows wins, losses, SKILL payouts, and BNB Fees over a 24 hours, 7 day, 31 day, and last 1000 fights view.

## How to Install in Chrome

Install a Chrome extension that will allow custom JS & CSS codefor websites. I recommend this extension but if anyone knows better ones I'm happy to add them to the list:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld?hl=en

Access this file and view the raw version of the code:
https://github.com/phoenix-tools/BladeMasterJS/blob/master/BladeMasterJS.js

Navigate to https://app.cryptoblades.io/#/

Open the newly installed Chrome Extension's Custom CSS and JS extension and create a new profile

Add the raw code that was copied earlier into the JavaScript panel, and save the profile.

And that's it! The next time you access https://app.cryptoblades.io/#/ the JavaScript code should be loaded and BladeMasterJS operating. 

If you have any trouble installing please reach out in the Discord private room for BladeMasters and I'll help asap.
